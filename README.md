# Fintech Bank Customer Churn Analysis

**Objective**

The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to identify and understand potential factors contributing to customer churn in the banking sector. In this context, "churn" refers to customers who choose to close their accounts or discontinue using the bank's services. By analyzing the data, the aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and key drivers behind customer attrition to support strategies for retention.
